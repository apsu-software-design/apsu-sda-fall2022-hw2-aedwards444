# The Gathering Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "Gatherings" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> The application can be split into two main parts, front end and back end. The front end contains the UI class while the backend must have 3 classes for Organization, Gatherings, and Members. In order for the code to be compiled smothly having a class manage all 3 backend classes was needed. 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I did look up basic typescript class structures since I am unfamiliar with the Typescript and Javascript but copied nothing verbadum nor asked a classmate for help.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 3


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 6


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Maybe introduce Arrays before the assignment since Arrays simplefiy things quite a bit.
